# trafficSignClassifier
This is a traffic sign classifier of 58 different classes, deployed on a Flask webapp 

Custom CNN model was trained with the TSRD (Traffic Sign Recognition Database)

Implemented the machine learning pipeline. (Data pre-processing, data normalization, data augmentation,
model training, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning)

Generated classification report to evaluate metrics (F1-score, precision, recall)

Tested both performances of custom CNN model and MobileNetv2 with transfer learning.

Deployed the custom model to local server, using Flask to create the web application.
